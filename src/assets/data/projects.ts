    From the outset, technology has aimed to overcome the limitations of the human body and enhance the adaptability and survival in a constantly evolving environment. Today, biohacking and transhumanism represent the forefront of our efforts to extend our bodies through sensors and devices, transforming us into living interfaces that fulfill our desire for self-knowledge and control.

    While these developments promise profound insights, they also raise critical questions about the nature of information and data, with users often left in the dark about how their data is transcoded and interpreted.

In addition, in recent years due to the increased performance from computer, machine learning has found its way more and more into our lives and technology seem to be getting more and more "intelligent". A technological consequence is the use of the increased "intelligence" to raise the efficiency of the surveillance.

In the installation “Sensus autem machina” (perception of the machine) I want to ask what kind of narrative arises when machines evaluate the image material from surveillance cameras and make statements about what is represented on the basis of object recognition.

With the installation my goal is to raise important questions. How “intelligent” are these machines
really? What conclusions do machines draw from what they “see”?
And what consequences can the use of machine learning have on us being monitored, if we blindly trust the machines?

    In the poetic interface, the sense of touch and sight are stimulated. Above all, however, the installation plays with the question of what perception can be achieved in the viewer,
when the two sensory impressions are not coupled with one another like the viewer is used to know. To alter the feeling, a black box is used to make a connection to the psychological meaning of black box.
The two holes on both sides add another level of encounter through the hands of another person.

The viewers only see on the screen an alienated version of what they feel in the black box.
Our interface thus creates a new aesthetic level of perception that contrasts with the haptic experience.
The decoupling of the visual and the sense of touch creates a poetic quality of the experience and opens up a new level of perception for the recipient.

              Humans used their last chance to survive, forced to develop new forms of living spaces.
              Hyper efficient technologies enabled them a life above the water. 
              These new living conditions led to new forms of nature.
              Organisms and structures emerged that only can exist under these new circumstances.
              Forms of life that coexist with the humans and generate high quality of life."

              N/FXTURE deals with the question of how human living space and nature could change in a
              speculative future if certain scenarios such as a profound climate change will become reality.`,

    description: `As a result of decades of human transformation of the earth, the "Anthropocene" appears to have entered as a new geological age in which humans
are the most powerful geophysical influence on the Earth’s systems.

But the man-made interventions in their environment and the resulting transformation of their own living environment not only worked in their favor.
They also led to negative consequences such as climatic changes, which threaten their own lives.

The virtual reality project "transmorphosis" is a 360° VR video that deals with the situation how a world could look like, that has been completely overhauled by humans towards themselves. It further raises the questions how the relationships between people and their environment and nature would develop under these new circumstances. To emphasize the notion that for many advocates of the Anthropocene hypothesis, the main culprits, the western industrialized nations and their "technocratic elite[s]" are—I consciously chose "white" skin color for this project.`,

[PART] is an augmented reality installation that generates an active and participatory experience of painting as an art form. The interplay of movement and resistance, interaction and immersion invites the viewer to participatory engagement with the medium of painting.

The artwork for the project was created by painter Dennis Henning. Through the medium of augmented reality, the painting expands into the virtual space generates a symbiosis between the analogue and digital artwork which leads to new horizons of aesthetic experiences.

Painting by Dennis Henning. Sound by Samuele Nestola. Project was realized in Unity and Blender.`,

    shortDescription: `Shift Space is an interactive online art gallery where the Artworks react to the users behavior`,
    description: `
    Due to the corona pandemic, digital cultural areas are becoming more relevant. The resulting events, however, differ greatly from ‘normal’ cultural events and must be thought and implemented differently.
Our project is a digital art exhibition that uses the opportunities of the digital room to create an alternative to the existing solutions.

In the shift space, users can explore the works of various artists by moving and looking around almost like in real life. The gallery comprises ten rooms in which nine artists are exhibited.
But that's not all. In order to enhance the experience of a typical analogue art exhibition we used the opportunities of the digital room. Above all, the change in the physics and space of the exhibition as well as the direct intervention in the movement and field of vision of the user enable the new experience a traditional exhibition couldn’t create. In the course of the gallery visit, these interventions increase and thus maintain the tension. In addition, the project is designed to be interactive so that viewers can influence the gallery and the works through their movement and behavior.
The project was developed in Unity. Individual works of art and models were designed in Cinema4D and Blender. 

We curated a selection of the artists works for the exhibition ourselves as part of the project.

                    The project was developed and designed in collaboration with Lukas Ruoff and Basil Boyacos`,

    description: `The idea of ​​melting ice masses destroyed by us human beings is there, but still remains abstract. What happens when individual parts of these masses face each other? 
                
                The installation 01101000EIS01110011 brings the viewer into this situation. Abstract from the outside, inside it shows a dissolving, dripping block of ice.
                A heat lamp constantly deforms it and changes the visual output outside the box together with other sensors and through human influence.

                Seen from the outside, only the abstract visualization is perceptible on the screen.
                In the second step, visitors are led into the interior of the 2 × 1.25 × 2.5 m box and see the glowing red block of ice on the base.
                The shape influenced by the heat lamp shows the outlines of the visualization, which are captured by a Kinect camera and transmitted to a Touchdesigner sketch.
                There the edge is tracked and the pixel image is converted into forms, while at the same time the threshold of the recorded video is continuously
                changed by a sine curve. This creates a kind of crystal structure or mosaic effect, which expands and shrinks inside the block and is reminiscent
                of an accelerated melting process. In addition, a colored veil emerges from the white edges, which is created by the sensor input and feedback loops.

                The red block of ice is visually and haptically interesting and the visitors can approach it, look at it from all sides and also touch it.
                A proximity sensor detects the distance between the visitor and the ice and changes the color value of the visualization to a warmer color spectrum,
                up to yellow, as the distance decreases. The temperature sensor influences the strength of the wiping effect, which becomes more extreme with increasing values.
                In addition, the experience is dramatized by the sounds of the dripping ice water, which are amplified by a steel sheet in the collecting container.`,
